# Evaluate demo

The purpose of this page is to demonstrate:

- how to display markdown content in html pages, such as this text. It is useful, because
  - one can write the content in markdown, which is easier to read and edit
  - can be reused elsewhere, e.g. the part at the [The calculator python project](#the-calculator-python-project) serves as the `README.md` for this evaluate project
- how to use some html and javascript to format or manipulate the UI:
  - note that latex is shown in html, and it is prettily rendered
  - the input field changes as the input type (single value, random or file) is modified
  - In case of successful calculation, a collapsible panel is offered to reveal some internal steps
- give an example how input file can be processed and how the results can offered for download
- how a given function can be interpreted using python. This latter is detailed in the section [The calculator python project](#the-calculator-python-project)
