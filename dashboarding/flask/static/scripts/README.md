# scripts

Here you need to provide bootstrap and jQuery, that are used in the Flask project. In the project, I include the following dependencies that you should copy here from the internet. The files' path are relative to this `README.md`:

- from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) 
  - `bootstrap-4.6.0-dist/css/bootstrap.css` 
  - `bootstrap-4.6.0-dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.js` 
- from [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/) the file `jquery-3.5.1.js`
