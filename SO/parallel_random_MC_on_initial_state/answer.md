I think it is worth to add some notes on the SeedSequences and spawns themselves, without involving the topic of parallel execution libraries.

## seed vs SeedSequence vs BitGenerator

You are right, it doesn't matter if you pass the final `numpy.random.Generator` object or just the same input, they all end up in an object that generates the same set of numbers.

```python
prng_seed = numpy.random.Generator(numpy.random.MT19937(0))

ss = numpy.random.SeedSequence(0)
prng_ss = numpy.random.Generator(numpy.random.MT19937(ss))
```
Both `prng_seed` and `prng_ss` will have the same state. You can check the state of the BitGenerator by accessing `prng_ss.bit_generator.state`. The 624 pieces of integers that define the state of a MT19937 is in `prng_ss.bit_generator.state["state"]["key"]`. You can generate these integers from the `SeedSequence` object `ss` too: `ss.generate_state(624)`.

The value 0 does not play the role of the seed number as it is detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Initialization), which is based on a [scientific paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1276927.1276928), but the `SeedSequence` implements a hash function that is responsible for generating the initial states. The value 0 can be still called as seed, but keep in mind that different seed values can lead to the same initial state as the pool size of SeedSequence's hash function if finite (by default, 2^128).

When you pass the BitGenerator to a thread, it will use its own copy, therefore generating random numbers in one thread does not affect other threads. If you pass the seed integers or the SeedSequence objects, the threads have to construct the BitGenerator objects. Many users use this technique, because they want different initial states, and it is cheaper to pass a single integer than passing the whole BitGenerator. Moreover, generating *N* pieces of BitGenerators with different initial state on the main thread can take more time than creating the BitGenerators on *N* threads, where each thread creates only 1 BitGenerator. But ofc, in your case, it is enough to construct only 1 BitGenerator, and copy it, therefore there is no remarkable speed gain.

## spawn

Using the spawn method and spawn key is just a bit more than providing another seed number for the BitGenerator. The advantage is that whenever you call `spawn(n)`, it automatically increases the extra seed number provided for the SeedSequence.

```python
ss_spawn = numpy.random.SeedSequence(entropy=7, spawn_key=())
print(ss_spawn.generate_state(1)) # 2083679832
print(ss_spawn) # entropy=7

child_1 = ss_spawn.spawn(1)[0]
print(ss_spawn.generate_state(1)) # 2083679832
print(ss_spawn) # entropy=7, n_children_spawned=1

child_2 = ss_spawn.spawn(1)[0]
print(ss_spawn.generate_state(1)) # 2083679832
print(ss_spawn) # entropy=0, n_children_spawned=2
```

But the generated children will be different:

```python
print(child_1) # entropy=0, spawn_key=(0,)
print(child_1.generate_state(1)) # 1201125462
print(child_2) # entropy=0, spawn_key=(1,)
print(child_2.generate_state(1)) # 3618983171
```

These children are not special snowflakes, they can be generated directly:

```python
ss_direct_child_1 = numpy.random.SeedSequence(entropy=7, spawn_key=(0,))
ss_direct_child_2 = numpy.random.SeedSequence(entropy=7, spawn_key=(1,))
print(ss_direct_child_1.generate_state(1)) # 1201125462
print(ss_direct_child_2.generate_state(1)) # 3618983171
```

Spawn key is just another source of entropy, as the documentation says. I.e. the effect is similar to adding the spawn key to the entropy directly, it will also generate a different state when executed. However, the implementation is apparently different, and I don't how to arrange the spawn key in the entropy to get the same state. Trailing 0s in the entropy are also discarded:
```python
ss_single = numpy.random.SeedSequence(entropy=7)
print(ss_single.generate_state(1)) # 2083679832
print(ss_single) # entropy=7
ss_single_w0 = numpy.random.SeedSequence(entropy=[7,0])
print(ss_single_w0.generate_state(1)) # 2083679832
print(ss_single_w0) # entropy=[7, 0]
```

## Clarification why the same set of random numbers are used

If I am not mistaken, you'd like to run a type of a simulation with a system of different initial states, where your system undergoes a stochastic process, and you'd like to do a statistical analysis on the results. Although you could use different random numbers to mimic the stochastic process, you believe that using the same set of random numbers will help you in analyzing the outcome. The differences between each realization of the simulation is provided by the different initial states.
